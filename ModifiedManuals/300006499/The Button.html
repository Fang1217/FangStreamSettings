							<h2>On the Subject of The Button</h2>
							<p class="flavour-text">You might think that a button telling you to press it is pretty straightforward. That’s the kind of thinking that gets people exploded.</p>
							<p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.<br />See Appendix B for battery identification reference.<br />See Appendix C for port identification reference.</p>
							<p>Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Perform the first action that applies:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>If there is more than 1 battery on the bomb, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
<li>If the button is red, press and immediately release when the two seconds digits on the timer match..</li>
<li>If the button is yellow, press and immediately release the button.</li>
<li>If there is a parallel port present on the bomb, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
<li>If the button is blue and there is a lit indicator with label SND, press and immediately release when the two seconds digits on the timer match..</li>
<li>If there is an empty port plate present on the bomb, press and immediately release the button.</li>
<li>If none of the above apply, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>

							</ol>
							<h3>Releasing a Held Button</h3>
							<p>If you start holding the button down, a colored strip will light up on the right side of the module. Based on its color you must release the button at a specific point in time:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><em>Red strip:</em> release when right most seconds digit is 9.</li>
<li><em>White strip:</em> release when the countdown timer has a 6 in any position.</li>
<li><em>Yellow strip:</em> release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position.</li>
<li><em>Any other color strip:</em> release when the two seconds digits add up to 5.</li>

							</ul>
