[Garfield Kart #1] Your character is: Garfield
[Garfield Kart #1] Stats: 1 speed, 1 acceleration, 1 handling
[Garfield Kart #1] The track is: Valley of the Kings
[Garfield Kart #1] This track is the 4th in the Pizza Cup.
[Garfield Kart #1] Puzzle pieces present: 1 2 3
[Garfield Kart #1] ==CALCULATION BEGINS HERE==
[Garfield Kart #1] 4 * 1 = 4 (Cup the track is on times number of cup)
[Garfield Kart #1] (4 % 13)! = 24 (All or no puzzle pieces, mod 13 then factorial G)
[Garfield Kart #1] 24 + 200 = 224 (G is less than 100)
[Garfield Kart #1] 224 * 1 = 224 (Multiply by speed, remove decimals)
[Garfield Kart #1] 224 + 8 = 232 (Add number of letters in character's name)
[Garfield Kart #1] 232 * 1 = 232 (Multiply by acceleration, rounding up)
[Garfield Kart #1] 232 * 5 = 1160 (Even amount of letters in track name, multiply by 5)
[Garfield Kart #1] 1160 * 1 = 1160 (Multiply by handling, remove decimals)
[Garfield Kart #1] (1160 % 6) + 1 = 3 (Modulo 6, then add 1)
