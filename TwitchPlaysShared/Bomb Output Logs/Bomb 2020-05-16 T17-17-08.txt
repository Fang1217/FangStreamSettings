[Rainbow Arrows #1] The display shows "89".
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (East - Binary Rotation) Base four bit number is 0b1010, or 10.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (East - Binary Rotation) Rotate right by 1 gives 0b0101, or 5.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (East - Binary Rotation) Moving 5 steps from North gives an answer of southwest.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southeast - Previous) Moving counter-clockwise from southwest, the first arrow not pressed is south.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southeast - Previous) Moving 1 step clockwise from that position leads to an answer of southwest.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] The above rule returned southwest, which wasn't unique. The closest unique arrow was west.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (South - Letter String) After modification 1, the string is "HABCDEFG".
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (South - Letter String) We want character 7 in the final string, and that's F.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (South - Letter String) The assigned arrow that corresponds to letter F is northwest.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "red", 0 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 0.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "orange", 0 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 0.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "yellow", 1 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 1.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "green", 0 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 0.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "blue", 1 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 1.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "indigo", 0 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 0.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "purple", 1 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 1.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) For the word "double", 1 serial number matches + 0 module matches = value of 1.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Southwest - Head Count) The best value obtained was from the word "yellow", so move 3 steps from the white arrow; the answer is southwest.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] The above rule returned southwest, which wasn't unique. The closest unique arrow was south.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (West - Adjacent Words) The word with the most letters in common with the serial number is "white", with 2.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (West - Adjacent Words) The starting letter is 'l'.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (West - Adjacent Words) The letter 'l' gives us a match in the southwest direction ('lower'), so the answer is southwest.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] The above rule returned southwest, which wasn't unique. The closest unique arrow was southeast.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Northwest - Appearance) Right digit present. The answer is east.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (North - Maze Navigation) Starting position (9) and ending position (9) are the same.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (North - Maze Navigation) Press the diagonal arrow corresponding to the relative location of square 9; the answer is southwest.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] The above rule returned southwest, which wasn't unique. The closest unique arrow was north.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Northeast - Arrow Direction) Rotating 356 degrees from the white arrow brings us closest to the east arrow.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] (Northeast - Arrow Direction) ... but we want the arrow directly opposite of that one; the answer is west.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] The above rule returned west, which wasn't unique. The closest unique arrow was northeast.
[Rainbow Arrows #1] ----------
[Rainbow Arrows #1] The full correct sequence is: southwest, west, northwest, south, southeast, east, north, northeast.
