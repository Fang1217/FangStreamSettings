[Legendre Symbol #1] Generated values 308, 613
[Legendre Symbol #1] One possible solution:
[Legendre Symbol #1]   (308|613)
[Legendre Symbol #1] = (2²|613) × (7|613) × (11|613)
[Legendre Symbol #1] = 1 × (613|7) × (613|11)
[Legendre Symbol #1] = (4|7) × (8|11)
[Legendre Symbol #1] = (2²|7) × (2²|11) × (2|11)
[Legendre Symbol #1]     11 mod 8 = 3, so (2|11) = -1
[Legendre Symbol #1] = 1 × 1 × -1
[Legendre Symbol #1] = -1
[Legendre Symbol #1] 308 is NOT a quadratic residue modulo 613.  Expected press: "N"
[Mystic Square #1] Last serial digit: 8; therefore, use columns
